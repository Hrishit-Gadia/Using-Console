        <h2>I Made This Project Using "VS (Visual Studio) Code"
            In VS Code we can create websites and many more.
            VS Code is an advanced version of Brackets.io.
        </h2>

        <h2>In this project I learned to Use console Screen
            (console screen is nothing but a place where the editer can see the changes)
            we can see console screen buy right clicking and selecting inspect then go to console section
            To pring sonething on console screen we can us "console.log(Write what to write)"
